# Silver Bullet Strategy — Accumulating NQ Backtest

Fully mechanical backtest of the ICT "Silver Bullet" setup on E-mini Nasdaq 100 (NQ) futures, 5-minute bars, updated automatically on a schedule (GitHub Actions pulling delayed Yahoo Finance data, plus optional IBKR pulls). Every run re-tests the entire accumulated history, so the trade sample below grows over time.

## By window (New York time)

| Window | Trades | Win rate | Net $ | Profit factor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| London 3-4am | 12 | 25.0% | −$2,135 | 0.63 |

## Cross-market robustness

Same mechanical rules run on other markets (continuous front-month, Yahoo data). Scored in **R-multiples** — profit measured in units of initial risk — so different point values compare fairly. NQ row uses the NQ trades above.

| Market | Trades | Win % | Avg R | Total R | Profit factor (R) | Net $ (1 contract) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NQ | 18 | 27.8% | -0.31 | -5.62 | 0.57 | −$3,865 |
| CL | 5 | 20.0% | -0.4 | -2.0 | 0.5 | −$240 |
| ES | 27 | 40.7% | 0.14 | 3.87 | 1.26 | +$942 |

## The mechanical rules

Windows 3–4 AM / 10–11 AM / 2–3 PM NY. Liquidity sweep = bar takes out the prior 2-hour extreme and closes back inside (scanned from 30 min before the window). First fair value gap (≥0.5 pt, displacement candle closing in bias direction) forming inside the window after the sweep. Limit entry at the near gap edge, must fill before window close. Stop 1 tick beyond the sweep extreme (skip if risk > 60 pts). Target 2R. 2-hour time exit. Same-bar stop+target counts as a loss. One trade per window. $10 round-trip costs, $20/point, 1 contract.

## Caveats

Data is IBKR's 10-minute-delayed consolidated feed (fine for end-of-day analysis). IBKR serves at most 3,500 bars (~13.5 trading days of 5-min) per pull, which is why this repo accumulates them twice weekly — a missed fortnight of runs would leave a permanent gap. Contract months are kept as separate price series to avoid roll artifacts; trades are deduplicated per (day, window) across contracts. Limit fills are assumed at the touched price with no queue — real fills would be somewhat worse.
